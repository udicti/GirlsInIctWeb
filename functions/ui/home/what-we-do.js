                    Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) drive growth and innovation worldwide, 
                    infiltrating all aspects of our lives. These ongoing advances in ICTs effectively make digital literacy a 
                    prerequisite for employment and entrepreneurship opportunities and are leading to a projected shortage of at 
                    least 2 million ICT employees worldwide by 2020. Studies show that not enough young people are choosing 
                    careers in ICT - especially not enough young women. Expanding the global technology talent pool to include 
                    more women with ICT skills can help fill this gap. This means investing in girls and young women today.
